                        2. Kumasi Technical University
                        Kumasi Technical University was established in 1954 as Kumasi Technical Institute (K.T.I.) to
                        offer craft courses. In 1963, the Institute was converted to a non-tertiary Polytechnic status
                        under the Ghana Education Service to start offering, in addition, technician diploma and sub-
                        professional courses.
                        The Polytechnic Law, 1992 (PNDC L.321) elevated the Polytechnic to a tertiary institution to
                        provide high calibre skilled manpower with reference to manufacturing, commerce, science and
                        technology to act as a catalyst for technological development. As a Polytechnic it was one of
                        the famous, elegant and vibrant Polytechnics in Ghana.
                        The Technical University Act 2016, (Act 922) converted Kumasi Polytechnic to the present Kumasi
                        Technical University with the aim of providing higher education in engineering, applied arts,
                        science technology-based disciplines, technical and vocational training.

                        3. Accra Technical University
                        Established in 1949 as a Technical School and commissioned in 1957 as Accra Technical Institute,
                        Accra Technical University then (Accra Technical Institute) became the first Technical
                        University to be established. In 1963 the Institute assumed a new name as Accra Polytechnic
                        under the directions of President Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to be a key driver of the country’s
                        industrialization process.
                        The elevation provided that the University under the Higher Education Council was vest with the
                        autonomy to award Higher National Diploma (HND) through the National Board for Professional and
                        Technical Examination (NABPTEX).
                        With the coming into force of the Polytechnic Act (Act 745) in 2007, the PNDC Law 321 of 1992
                        was repealed to allow polytechnics the autonomy to award Higher National Diplomas (HND),
                        Diplomas, Certificates and other degrees that the Polytechnic may deem appropriate, all
                        accredited by the National Accreditation Board.
                        The Technical University Act, 2016, (Act 922) converted together with 8 other Polytechnics,
                        Accra Polytechnic to Accra Technical University, given it a Technical University status.
                        The elevation was aimed at enhancing technical training with emphasis on producing world-class
                        graduates moulded in excellence and professionalism in diverse technical programmes in theory
                        and in practice.
                        Currently, the University has 5 faculties – Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Built
                        Environment, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Applied Arts, and Faculty of Business – and
                        16 departments.

                        4. Takoradi Technical University
                        The Takoradi Technical University was established in September, 2016, as a result of the
                        government’s policy to convert Takoradi Polytechnic, among five other Polytechnics, to the
                        status of Technical University. In effect, since April 1954, Takoradi Technical University
                        (formerly Takoradi Polytechnic) has existed as a Government Technical Institute under the Ghana
                        Education Service of the Ministry of Education.
                        During that period, the institute offered programmes mainly at the Craft and Technician
                        Certificate levels in commercial and technical subjects, awarding Royal Society of Arts (RSA)
                        and City and Guilds of London, United Kingdom. However, in 1990, the Ghana Education Service
                        took over the awards of the above-mentioned certificates.
                        Currently, Takoradi Technical University has three (3) campuses: Effia Kuma (Takoradi),
                        Butumagyebu (Sekondi) and Akatakyi (Agona-Nkwanta). The Akatakyi Campus is the largest of the
                        three.
                        Takoradi Technical University has the mandate to develop appropriate attitudes and required
                        skills in Information Technology (IT) and entrepreneurship to equip the students with such basic
                        skills for industry and to promote industrialization through relevant research, consultancy and
                        linkage programmes, for social and economic development in the region and the country as a
                        whole.
                        It is a place for hands-on learning, practicals, discovery, innovation, expression and
                        discourse. The objective of the University is to provide higher education in the engineering,
                        science and technology-based disciplines, technical and vocational programmes, applied arts and
                        related disciplines. However, Takoradi Technical University has dynamically positioned itself to
                        focus on its two core faculties, which are Engineering and Applied Sciences.

                        5. Ho Technical University
                        The origin of the Ho Technical University goes back to 1968. It was established as a Technical
                        Institute with the primary objective of providing pre-technical education. By 1972, the
                        institute had made tremendous progress in upgrading of the courses offered. Consequently, the
                        pre-technical programmes gave way to courses in the Engineering and Vocational fields, e.g.,
                        Basic Engineering, Agricultural and Mechanical Engineering, Building Technology and Business
                        Education.
                        In 1986, the Institute became a Polytechnic. It however continued to operate as second cycle
                        institution, until 1993 when the Polytechnic was upgraded to a fully-fledged tertiary
                        institution by the enactment of PNDC Law 321 and charged with the responsibility of training
                        students in the technical and vocational skills to the Higher National Diploma [HND] level.
                        Subsequently, in 2007, Polytechnics were given the mandate by the Polytechnics Act 745 to award
                        their own degrees to the highest level.
                        Ho Technical University has the mandate to award degrees, diplomas, certificates and other
                        qualifications to the highest level in Engineering, Science and Technology based disciplines,
                        Technical and Vocational Education and Training, Applied Arts and related disciplines.
                        The university is on a mission to train highly competent human resource to the highest level
                        possible through career-focused education, skill training and research in partnership with
                        stakeholders.
                        Since then, the Polytechnic has been running programmes from non-tertiary level to the bachelor
                        degree level. This year, the Polytechnic has been given the permit to run Masters in
                        Agricultural Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

                        Professional and Technician examinations (NABTEX).
                        The object of the polytechnic education in Ghana was to train students to be equipped with the
                        middle level manpower skills, so as to support industry and commerce in the areas of resource
                        and information development.

                        to match the challenges of the new century.

                        7. Sunyani Technical University
                        The University started as Sunyani Technical Institute (SUTECH) in 1967 to offer technical and
                        vocational education and training to Middle School Leavers, and later on, to Junior Secondary
                        School graduates in hands-on Craft/Intermediate Block-Laying and Concreting, Carpentry and
                        Joinery, Furniture Craft as well as Painting and Decoration programmes.
                        In 1997, Sunyani Technical Institute was upgraded to Sunyani Polytechnic (SPOLY) in line with
                        government policy to stress on Technical/Vocational Education and Training (TVET) at the
                        tertiary level. The enabling law, the Polytechnics Act 745 empowered the institution to offer
                        tertiary education programmes, principally, Higher National Diploma (HND) in areas in response
                        to national human resource needs at the tertiary level.
                        In addition, non-tertiary courses which were being offered in the previous era continued to run
                        as certificated skilled-based courses to serve industry and also feed the HND programmes. Within
                        this period of Polytechnic status, the first corporate strategic plan was formulated to guide
                        the growth and management of the institution from 2005-2015.
                        In 2016, Sunyani Polytechnic was converted to Sunyani Technical University (STU) and given a new
                        mandate through the coming into force of the Technical Universities Act 2016 (Act 922 as
                        amended).
                        The Technical Universities Act mandates the University to provide higher education and award
                        degrees, diplomas and other certificates in Engineering, Science, and Technology-based
                        disciplines as well as Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Applied Arts and
                        related disciplines.
                        The conversion to Technical University has necessitated reforms in internal governance
                        structures and realignment of programmes and departments, increased investment in staff capacity
                        development and infrastructures as well as the formulation and implementation of the second
                        corporate strategic plan for 2015-2020, which is currently being replaced by a new strategic
                        plan for 2020 – 2025.
                        Currently, Sunyani Technical University offers Bachelor of Technology Degree Programmes, Higher
                        National Diploma (HND) and Non-Tertiary Programmes in Engineering, Science and Technology, TVET,
                        and Applied Arts disciplines.
                        Other programmes offered included Electrical Installation, Motor Vehicle Mechanics, Mechanical
                        Engineering Craft Practice, Welding and Fabrication, Cookery for the catering and hospitality
                        industry and Business Studies with options in Accounting and Secretarial management. It is
                        interesting to note that, some of these courses are still being offered by the University to
                        different targeted groups through the Council for Technical and Vocational Education and
                        Training (COTVET).
