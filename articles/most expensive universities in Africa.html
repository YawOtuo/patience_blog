                        Top 10 Most Expensive Universities in Africa
                        Africa is home to some of the most beautiful universities in the world, however tuition in these
                        universities is very expensive because these schools get little or no assistance from the
                        government to embark on research projects. Although higher education has greatly improved, this
                        article will talk about ten of the most expensive universities in Africa in terms of tuition
                        fees.
                        University education in Africa is important to the development of Africa because education
                        especially in Africa is taking a fast-paced change and transformation.
                        As of 2018 there were one thousand six hundred and eighty-two universities in the African
                        continent and it increased to seven hundred and eighty-four in the year 2000 and this statistic
                        clearly shows that university or higher education has greatly improved in Africa.
                        Some challenges faced by these schools is that some faculties have underdeveloped infrastructure
                        and this makes education not reach everyone and even some of the expensive schools are not
                        excluded from some challenges like little data protection and sometimes the data available is
                        not accurate.
