                    <h1> TOP TEN BEST COMPANIES TO WORK FOR IN GHANA</h1>
                    <p>One of the reasons why employees will choose to work in the best companies is because of the
                        qualities the companies possess. Most top companies in Ghana maintain certain essential
                        qualities that attract employees to them. Apparently, these qualities are what makes a company a
                        great place to work.</p>

                    <p>
                        The best companies to work for in Ghana possess qualities which will be the four main criteria
                        we will be looking for in this article. First and most importantly, they must provide
                        competitive salaries and benefit packages, secondly, they must create a sense of pride in their
                        workers, thirdly, give training, career growth and development and finally, have a good company
                        culture and work environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>Companies that offer huge salaries are good, and it captions their value. However, that is not
                        the only quality used in rating a company as top. Rating them based on these four criteria gives
                        us a wholistic view of the company.</p>

                        On the 4th March 1957, just two days before the declaration of political independence, the Bank
                        of Ghana was formally established. The establishment of Bank of Ghana boosted public morale and

                        The bank of Ghana is also regarded as the Central Bank of the country. The Central Bank of Ghana

                        • regulate, supervise and direct the banking and credit system and ensure the smooth operation
                        of the financial sector;
                        • promote, regulate and supervise payment and settlement systems;
                        • issue and redeem the currency notes and coins;
                        • ensure effective maintenance and management of Ghana's external financial services;
                        • license, regulate, promote and supervise non-banking financial institutions;
